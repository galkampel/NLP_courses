# Symbols in the grammar are case-sensitive.
# 
# This grammar uses a convention that
#    - terminals are lowercase          (president)
#    - preterminals are capitalized     (Noun)
#    - other nonterminals are all-caps  (NP)
# 
# This convention just makes grammars more readable to humans.  Thus:
#
#    - When *you* are writing grammars, you should 
#      follow this convention unless you have a good reason not to.  
#
#    - But the  *program* should still work with grammars that don't
#      follow this convention.  So how can the program reliably tell
#      the difference between terminal and nonterminal symbols?  If
#      there is at least one rule for rewriting a symbol, then that
#      symbol is a nonterminal and should be rewritten.

# Vocabulary.  Your program can see that "ate" is a terminal
# symbol because there exists no rule for rewriting it.
# Any symbol that can rewrite as a terminal (or a string of 
# terminals, like "chief of staff") is called a "preterminal."  Notice 
# that a preterminal is a special kind of nonterminal.
